## ------------------------------Description-------------------------------


```
## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours of 9am to 5pm
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

## Why I did this:
I wanted to push my boundries for working in API's.
## Problem solved: 
I was able to create a functional quiz with Javaacript logic.
## Learning journey:
I learned how to:
 -Generate text from JS through the DOM
 -Use event listeners to get the desired results.
